# creation-day

A day in the life of a canvas.

[DEMO](https://gwest7.github.io/creation-day/)

The idea to make this came from realising the basic elements of impressive sunset/sunrise landscape images. This was a one day project done on Saturday, 26 Feb 2022 (hench the name "creation day" and intended pun). No code was copied, except for examples documented in MDN Web Docs.
