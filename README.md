# creation-day

A day in the life of a canvas.

[VIEW](https://gwest7.github.io/creation-day/)

An attempt to recreate the basic elements of sunset/sunrise landscape photos using canvas. This was a one day project done on Saturday, 26 Feb 2022. I pushed a few days later and made some teaks since. No code was copied, except for examples documented in MDN Web Docs.

### TODO:
* Add a landscape object (perhaps a tree) with moving shadow
* Give the earth a radial fill affected by die sun
