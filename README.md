# creation-day

A day in the life of a canvas.

[DEMO](https://gwest7.github.io/creation-day/)

The idea to make this came from realising the basic elements of impressive sunset/sunrise landscape images. No code was copied, except for examples documented in MDN Web Docs.

## Todo
* Have stars move as the earch orbits. Movement will follow the moon, but slower.
* Friendlier and more appropriate hello message. (Good morning/afternoon/evening/night world.)
